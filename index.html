              <h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
              <p> Hello, my name is Hong Yeonseo, and my English name is Dianne. I was born in 2001 in South Korea, and I came to Canada for my high school studies. I have a great passion for animation and enjoy listening to music. I embrace challenges and have never been afraid to try new things. From a young age, I've had an interest in design, and as I pursued that passion, I found myself attending a design school here in Canada. My ultimate goal is to become the UX designer I aspire to be. Also the logo represents me. I aimed for a minimalist and classic design, reflecting my pursuit of simplicity and showcasing the beauty of restraint.</p>

              <h3> ABOUT MY DOGS </h3>
              <p> I have two beloved dogs in my life. One of them is a Bichon Frise named Gurum Hong. Gurum is incredibly calm and has a personality that's more like a cat than a typical dog. When it comes to going for a walk, Gurum tends to hide under the table or the bed. On the other hand, Bambi Hong is a Maltese and Poodle mix known as a "Maltipoo." Bambi is very fond of people and dogs, with a friendly disposition. However, one drawback is that Bambi doesn't quite understand how to greet others properly and tends to bark when approaching. Despite their quirks, they are both incredibly adorable and precious to me.</p>

              <h3> ABOUT MY FAVORITE MUSIC </h3>
              <p> Lastly, let me describe my favorite songs. First, there's "Bad" by a Korean band called Wavetoearth. Then, there's "Nothing" by Bruno Major. These songs bring me a lot of comfort. When I listen to them, my mood improves, and they make me feel happy.</p>
